# AI-Fitness-App
creating a fitness app, which uses AI to manage the users development and growth. App will need to use data collected from phone fitness tracking (steps and sleep) and then will need to initially see what the user is trying to achieve (weight/body goals) then based on information collected, offer a workout and diet program (with suggested meals/cals to target to achieve goals) of which will help them achieve there goals. It will every week go through a reflection with the user, motivate them with notifications to get more steps/sleep, and overall, make changes to workout / diet based on reflections each week. The app will have a simple membership system (1 month free) , followed by $5 per week after trial. 
==========================
Creating a fitness app that leverages AI to manage a user's development, track their progress, and offer personalized workouts and diet recommendations involves several steps. Below is a Python-based backend implementation for the key components you described, such as managing user data, calculating fitness goals, providing workout/diet plans, and handling weekly reflections with notifications.

Since youâ€™re aiming for a full-featured app, the backend code here will focus on the core logic, including user management, AI-driven recommendations, and progress tracking. The front end (UI, membership system, notifications, etc.) would require integration with a framework like React Native (for mobile apps) or React (for web apps).
Python Code for Backend Fitness App

    User Data & Progress Tracking:
        Collect and track fitness data (steps, sleep, etc.)
        Track and store user goals (weight, body composition, etc.)
        Adjust workout and diet plans based on user progress.

    AI for Fitness Goal Achievement:
        Use AI to dynamically adjust workout plans, diets, and suggestions based on progress.
        Collect weekly reflections and optimize workout and diet recommendations.

    Notifications & Weekly Reflections:
        Provide weekly reflections to motivate users and make adjustments to their plans based on feedback.

    Membership System:
        Offer a 1-month free trial, followed by weekly payments.

We'll use the Flask framework for the API and integrate basic AI for generating workout/diet plans. The AI part can later be expanded to use more sophisticated models based on user feedback.
Setup: Install Required Libraries

Before starting the Python implementation, make sure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy pandas numpy

Key Features:

    User Signup and Membership System:
        Users can sign up with basic details (username, email, weight goal).
        They are given a 1-month free trial. After the trial, the app switches to a paid model (with weekly payments).

    Tracking Weekly Progress:
        Users can submit their weekly progress (steps, sleep hours, and feedback). AI or basic logic will use this data to adjust their workout and diet plans accordingly.

    Personalized Recommendations:
        The app generates dynamic workout and diet recommendations based on user goals and progress.

    Weekly Reflections & Notifications:
        Users receive feedback and can reflect on their progress. Notifications are sent for motivation and reminders.

    Backend Structure:
        Flask with SQLAlchemy for managing user data and weekly progress. You could extend this to handle more advanced user metrics like body composition and muscle gain.

Next Steps:

    AI Model Enhancement: Implement more advanced AI to dynamically adjust recommendations based on more complex patterns and data analysis.
    Payment Integration: Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe for managing the subscription payments after the trial period.
    Frontend Development: Build a mobile frontend (using React Native) that interacts with this backend and includes UI elements for users to view their progress, goals, and receive notifications.

This provides the structure for your fitness app, and you can build out the front end, expand AI features, and further optimize user experience based on feedback and analytics.
